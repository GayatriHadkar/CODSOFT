# CODSOFT
This repository is part of my Python Programming internship at CODSOFT. It includes 3 tasks that I must complete to demonstrate my proficiency in Python.
1)CALCULATOR:-This Python script allows users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /). It uses conditional statements to compute the result based on the chosen operation and displays the outcome in a clear format. It provides a simple interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations.
2)CONTACT BOOK:- This contact management system offers a user-friendly interface for effortless contact handling. Users can add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, and address. The system provides a clear list view of all contacts, allowing quick identification through names and phone numbers. A robust search function enables rapid retrieval of contacts by name or phone number, while also supporting updates and deletions to maintain an organized and efficient database.
3)PASSWORD GENERATOR:- 
To create a password generator in Python, you can prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password. Using Python's random module, you can then generate a password by combining random characters up to the specified length. Finally, display the generated password on the screen to provide the user with a strong and secure password tailored to their requirements.
